## Application for searching for recipes

Application uses free search API for getting data. I created it using different technologies, such as:

- React JS
- React Router
- Material UI
- Prop-Types
- Sass

To search for different recipes you have to input some text in the upper right corner of the app. It will collect valuable data from the API and show you what you're looking for. You can type ingredients or certain recipe names.
